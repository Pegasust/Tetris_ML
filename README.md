# Tetris_ML
Tetris project that highly ties with ML for this game

# TODOs:

- Implement NEAT, feature-selection NEAT

- Use NEAT in my TetrisML model

- Reimplement random linear-regression with 0 hidden layers neural network that I implemented in senior high school year.

- OpenCl parallelization

- ARMx86 (Raspberry Pi) compatibility

- Actual screen pixel renderers (OpenGL/Vulkan)
